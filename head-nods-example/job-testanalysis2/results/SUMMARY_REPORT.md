# Statistical Analysis Report: Feedback vs Affirmation Across Languages

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Dataset:** function_wide_all_languages.csv  
**Analysis:** Comparison of feedback and affirmation gestures across four languages

---

## Executive Summary

This report examines whether feedback and affirmation gestures differ significantly in their kinematic properties (length, amplitude, and velocity) across four languages: German Sign Language (DGS_2.0_2412), German Spoken (GER_2412), Russian Sign Language (RSL_2507), and Russian Spoken (RUS_2503). After removing outliers, Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted on 12,822 observations.

**Key Findings:**
- **Affirmations consistently show higher amplitude and velocity** than feedback across most languages
- **German spoken language (GER_2412)** shows the strongest differentiation with large effect sizes
- **Russian spoken language (RUS_2503)** shows the least differentiation
- **Sample sizes are adequate** for detecting medium-to-large effects but may miss small effects

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
- **Outlier removal:** Applied IQR method (Q1 - 1.5×IQR to Q3 + 1.5×IQR)
- **Outliers removed:** Ranged from 1-101 observations per comparison
- **Sample retention:** High (typically >90% of original data)

### 2.2 Statistical Test Selection

**Why Mann-Whitney U Test?**

The Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric) was chosen over the t-test (parametric) for the following reasons:

1. **Non-normal distributions:** Shapiro-Wilk tests showed:
   - 100% of feedback groups are non-normal (p < 0.05)
   - 91.7% of affirmation groups are non-normal (p < 0.05)

2. **Test comparison:** When comparing t-test vs Mann-Whitney U:
   - Tests agreed 75% of the time (9/12 comparisons)
   - Tests disagreed in 3 cases, highlighting assumption violations

3. **Advantages of Mann-Whitney U:**
   - Fewer assumptions (no normality requirement)
   - More robust to skewed data and outliers
   - More conservative (lower false positive rate)
   - Appropriate for unequal group sizes

### 2.3 Sample Size Adequacy

**After outlier removal:**

| Language     | Feedback n | Affirmation n | Adequacy |
|--------------|------------|---------------|----------|
| DGS_2.0_2412 | 627-634    | 88-91         | ✅ Good   |
| GER_2412     | 685-694    | 45-46         | ✅ Acceptable |
| RSL_2507     | 1,392-1,422| 34-39         | ✅ Acceptable |
| RUS_2503     | 409-422    | 27-29         | ⚠️ Marginal |

**Power considerations:**
- All samples adequate for detecting medium-to-large effects (Cohen's d ≥ 0.5)
- Reduced power for detecting small effects (Cohen's d < 0.3)
- Affirmation groups represent only 2-13% of combined samples (highly unbalanced)
- Smaller samples (RUS_2503) may miss true effects (Type II error risk)

## 4. Cross-Linguistic Patterns

### 4.1 Consistent Findings

1. **Amplitude:** Affirmation > Feedback in 3/4 languages (significant in 2/4)
2. **Velocity:** Affirmation > Feedback in 4/4 languages (significant in 3/4)
3. **Length:** No consistent pattern across languages

### 4.2 Language-Specific Patterns

**German languages (DGS & GER):**
- Strongest differentiation between feedback and affirmation
- Large effect sizes for velocity
- GER shows exceptionally large effects (d > 1.1)

**Russian languages (RSL & RUS):**
- Weaker differentiation between feedback and affirmation
- Smaller effect sizes overall
- RUS_2503 shows no significant differences (possibly due to power issues)

### 4.3 Modality Differences (Sign vs Spoken)

**Sign languages (DGS & RSL):**
- Medium effect sizes for velocity differences
- More subtle differences overall

**Spoken languages (GER & RUS):**
- Variable patterns
- GER: Very strong effects
- RUS: No significant effects

**Note:** Cannot draw strong modality conclusions due to language confounds and unequal sample sizes.

## 5. Methodological Considerations

### 5.1 Strengths

✅ Large overall sample size (12,822 observations)  
✅ Appropriate non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U)  
✅ Systematic outlier removal  
✅ Multiple languages and modalities  
✅ Multiple kinematic measurements  
✅ Effect sizes reported alongside p-values  

### 5.2 Limitations

⚠️ **Unbalanced samples:** Affirmations represent only 2-13% of data  
⚠️ **Small affirmation groups:** Some languages have n < 30  
⚠️ **Reduced power:** May miss small effects, especially in RUS_2503  
⚠️ **Non-normal distributions:** Even after outlier removal  
⚠️ **Unequal group sizes:** Reduces statistical power  
⚠️ **Language confounds:** Cannot separate language from modality effects  

### 5.3 Potential Confounds

1. **Cultural differences:** Languages come from different cultural contexts
2. **Recording conditions:** May vary across language datasets
3. **Annotation criteria:** "Affirmation" and "feedback" may be defined differently across languages
4. **Individual differences:** Not accounted for in current analysis
5. **Contextual factors:** Conversational context not considered

---

## 6. Interpretation and Discussion

### 6.1 Main Finding

**Affirmations are kinematically distinct from feedback, characterized by:**
- **Higher velocity** (consistent across 3/4 languages)
- **Higher amplitude** (consistent across 2/4 languages)
- **Similar duration** (no consistent differences)

### 6.2 Theoretical Implications

This pattern suggests that affirmations may be:
1. **More emphatic:** Higher velocity and amplitude indicate stronger gestures
2. **More salient:** Larger, faster movements are more visually/physically prominent
3. **Functionally distinct:** Different communicative goals require different gesture properties

### 6.3 Language Variation

The large effect sizes in German (especially GER_2412) versus minimal effects in Russian (RUS_2503) suggest:
1. **Cultural differences** in how affirmation is expressed
2. **Language-specific conventions** for feedback/affirmation gestures
3. **Modality interactions** with language-specific patterns

### 6.4 Statistical Power Concerns

**Impact of small affirmation samples:**

| Scenario | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Significant result** | Highly trustworthy (hard to achieve with low power) |
| **Non-significant with small effect** | Cannot distinguish true null from insufficient power |
| **Non-significant with medium/large effect** | More confident in true null hypothesis |

**RUS_2503 results:** Should be interpreted with particular caution due to smallest sample sizes.

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 For Reporting These Results

1. ✅ **Report effect sizes** alongside p-values (Cohen's d already included)
2. ✅ **Acknowledge sample size limitations** in discussion
3. ✅ **Use Mann-Whitney U test** results (appropriate for this data)
4. ✅ **Report both significant and non-significant findings** with caveats
5. ✅ **Include descriptive statistics** (means, SDs) for transparency
6. 📊 **Consider adding confidence intervals** for effect sizes
7. 📊 **Consider visualizations** (boxplots showing distributions)

### 7.2 For Future Research

1. 🔬 **Collect more affirmation data** to increase power
2. 🔬 **Balance sample sizes** across groups (aim for 1:1 ratio)
3. 🔬 **Add more languages** to test cross-linguistic generalizability
4. 🔬 **Control for context** (conversational setting, participants, etc.)
5. 🔬 **Include individual-level analysis** (mixed-effects models)
6. 🔬 **Separate modality from language** with better design
7. 🔬 **Pre-register hypotheses** for confirmatory analysis
8. 🔬 **Conduct formal power analysis** before data collection

### 7.3 Statistical Suggestions

1. **For larger datasets:**
   - Consider mixed-effects models to account for individual differences
   - Explore interaction effects (language × gesture type)
   - Examine distributional properties more closely

2. **For small samples:**
   - Consider Bayesian approaches (more informative with small samples)
   - Report confidence intervals
   - Consider equivalence testing for non-significant results

## 8. Conclusions

### 8.1 Primary Conclusions

1. ✅ **Affirmations differ kinematically from feedback** in velocity and amplitude
2. ✅ **German languages show strongest differentiation** (large effect sizes)
3. ✅ **Russian spoken shows least differentiation** (no significant effects)
4. ✅ **Mann-Whitney U test is appropriate** for this non-normal data
5. ⚠️ **Sample sizes are adequate but not ideal** (sufficient for medium effects only)

### 8.2 Confidence in Findings

| Finding | Confidence Level | Rationale |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| GER_2412 effects | **HIGH** | Large effect sizes, adequate sample, highly significant |
| DGS_2.0_2412 velocity | **HIGH** | Medium effect, largest sample, highly significant |
| RSL_2507 effects | **MEDIUM** | Small effects, adequate sample, just significant |
| DGS_2.0_2412 amplitude | **MEDIUM** | Marginally non-significant (p=0.095) |
| RUS_2503 effects | **LOW** | Small sample, non-significant, underpowered |

### 8.3 Final Statement

This analysis provides **strong evidence** that affirmations are kinematically distinct from feedback gestures, particularly in their **velocity and amplitude** properties. However, the strength of this distinction varies considerably across languages, with German showing much stronger differentiation than Russian. The findings are robust for languages with adequate samples but should be interpreted cautiously for Russian spoken language due to power limitations.

## Appendix: Statistical Test Details

### A.1 Mann-Whitney U Test

**Formula:** Ranks all observations together, tests if ranks differ between groups

**Assumptions:**
- Independent observations ✓
- Ordinal or continuous data ✓
- Similar distributions in both groups (for median interpretation) ✓

**Interpretation:**
- Significant result = distributions differ in location (median/mean)
- Effect size (Cohen's d) = standardized difference between groups

### A.2 Effect Size Interpretation (Cohen's d)

| Cohen's d | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| < 0.2     | Negligible     |
| 0.2-0.5   | Small          |
